VIDEO QUESTIONS:
When combining loops with control structures, which of the following best describes their combined functionality?
    Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple timesm and control structures (like if-else and switch statements) will enable you to make decisions during each iteration of the loop based on specific conditions

Which loop structure should you use if you know the exact number of iterations required to process each element in an array?
    For loop

break -> permite sair de um loop ou de um switch

VIDEO QUESTION:
What does the term "loop optimization" refer to in programming?
    Techniques to make loops operate faster and use fewer resources

GUIDED LAB:

Step 1
Int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5};

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine(numbers[i]);
}

Step 2
int counter = 1;

while (counter <= 10) {
    Console.WriteLine(counter);
    counter++;
}

Step 3
int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5};

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++) {
    if (numbers[i] % 2 == 0) {
        Console.WriteLine(numbers[i] + " is even.");
    }
    else {
        Console.WriteLine(numbers[i] + " is odd.");
    }
}

PRACTICE QUIZ:
1. Which statement best describes the use of loops with control structures in programming?
    Loops handle repetition, while control structures make decisions during each loop iteration

2. Which type of loop is best suited for a scenario where the number of iterations is known in advance?
    The For loop is best suited when the number os iterations is known beforehand

3. Which technique is recommended to optimize the performance of loops in a program?
    The technique minimizes iterations and voides nested loops when possible

4. Which of the following C# code snippets will iterate the most times?
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        Console.WriteLine("Number :" + i);
    }
