VIDEO QUESTIONS:
Which of the following is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition?
    For loop

What is the primary purpose of using a while loop in programming?
    To execute a code block continuously until a condition is met

DO-WHILE LOOPS:
Executa o bloco de código pelo menos uma vez. Depois faz o teste e, em função da avaliação da condição, continuar a executar, até a avaliação for False


VIDEO QUESTION:
What is the primary difference between a do-while loop and a while loop in programming?
    A do-while loop guarantees the code block will execute at least once before checking the condition, while a while loop checks the condition first and may not execute the code block at allow at all

PRACTICE QUIZ:
1. What is the primary purpose of a "for” loop in programming?
    To automate repetitive tasks when the number of iterations is known

2. When would you use a "while loop" in programming?
    When you need to execute code repeatedly as long as a conditions is true

3. What is a key characteristic of a "do-while loop" that distinguishes it from other loops?
    It guarantees the code block will execute at least once before checking the condition

4. Why are loops (for, while, do-while) important in programming?
    They efficiently handle repetitive taks with minimal code
