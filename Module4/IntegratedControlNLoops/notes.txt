VIDEO QUESTIONS:
When integrating if-else statements with loops in a program, which of the following approaches would allow you to check conditions for each item in a list effectively?
    Use a loop to go through each item in the list and place an if-else statement inside the loop to check a condition for each item

How does combining a switch statement with a loop help manage complex conditions?
    It enables you to efficiently evaluate different values of a variable and perform specific actions based on those values, iterating through a collection of items

PRACTICE QUIZ:
1. Which of the following demonstrates a correct method to combine an if-else statement with a loop in a coding exercise?
    Use a loop to go through each item in a list and place an if-else statement inside the loop to check conditions

2. What is the primary benefit of combining switch cases with loops in a coding exercise?
    To evaluate different values of a variable and perform specific actions while iterating

3. Which of the following C# code snippets correctly combines control structures and loops?
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i ++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            Console.WriteLine("Even number: " + i);
        }
        else {
            Console.WriteLine("Odd number: " + i);
        }
    }

GRADED QUIZ:
1. A menu-driven application needs to handle user commands (e.g., start, stop, exit) efficiently. Which control structure is best suited for this purpose?
    A switch statement, because it organizes discrete cases clearly, making the code easier to maintain

2. A program requires validating a userâ€™s age input to ensure it is between 18 and 60. Which control structure is most effective?
    An if-else statement, because it allows checking ranges providing feedback for invalid inputs

3. A program needs to sum the elements of an array with 10 numbers. Which loop structure is most suitable and why?
    A for loop, because it iterates through the array sequentially and efficiently processes each element

4. A guessing game requires the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. How would you combine loops and if-else statements for this task?
    Use a do-while loop to keep prompting the user for guesses until conrrect, and an if-else statement to validate each guess

5. You are designing a program to process customer requests in a queue. How can you efficiently combine loops and switch statements for this task?
    Use a while loop to process each request and switch statement to handle the request type

6. Which control structure is most suitable for ensuring a password meets a minimum length requirement?
    Use an if-else statement to check if the password length is valid and prompt the user if it is not

7. Which loop structure would you use to prompt a user for input until they enter a valid value, and why?
    A do-while loop, because it ensures the input prompt is displayed at least once before checking validity

8. How would you use a loop to calculate the product of each element in a one-dimensional array with a fixed multiplier?
    Use a single for loop to iterate through the array abd multiply each element by the fixed multiplier

9. How would you combine loops and if-else statements to create a guessing game where a user guesses a number between 1 and 10?
    Use a do-while loop to keep prompting the user for guesses until correct, and an if-else statement to validate each guess

10. Which C# snippet best demonstrates a while loop combined with an if-else statement to sum all positive numbers in an array?
    int[] numbers = {-1, 5, 10, -3};
    int i = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    while (i < numbers.Length) {
    if (numbers[i] > 0) {
    sum += numbers[i];
    }
    i++;
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
