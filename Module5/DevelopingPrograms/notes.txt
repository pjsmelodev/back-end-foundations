SINGLE RESPONSABILITY PRINCIPLE:
A class, function, or module should hove only one reason to change, which means should only be responsible for one specific funcionality or task

VIDEO QUESTIONS:
In the context of program design, what is the 'Single Responsibility Principle'?
    A class, function, or module should have only one reason to change

How is a method different from a function in the context of C#?
    A method is a function that is part of a class

What is the primary purpose of planning the program flow before starting implementation?
    To determinr the sequence of function calls, data flow, and where loops and conditionals are necessary

PRACTICE QUIZ:
Imagine you are designing a banking application. Which approach ensures the program is modular and easier to maintain by combining related tasks like checking balances and processing withdrawals?
    Use functions and methods to modularize tasks and interactions

You are tasked with building an inventory system. What is the most efficient way to handle repetitive tasks, such as calculating total stock value?
    Use a function or method to encapsulate the calculation logic and resuse it as needed

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive library management system. How should you integrate user authentication, book checkouts, and returns into the program?
    Plan the program flow by defining how functions and methods will interact

In a library management system, which programming principle ensures each function or method is responsible for only one task, such as checking out books or adding new titles?
    Single Responsability Principle

GRADED QUIZ:
Why would a developer create a function to validate user input in a web application?
    To centralize the validation logic, making it reusable across multiple input fields

What happens when a method in C# has a return type specified?
    The method must return a value of the specified type, ensuring the output aligns with the method's definition

A developer uses the function calculateArea(length, width) to process inputs. What will happen if they call calculateArea(10)?
    The function will throw an erros due to a missing argument for width

A developer creates a method that returns a calculated tax amount. How can the return value improve program efficiency?
    The return value allows the program to reuse the tax calculation result in other operations without recalculating

A developer uses parameters in a function. How do parameters enhance code reusability?
    They allow functions to process different inputs without changing the funcion's code

What is the result of calling PrintMessage() on a method defined as public void PrintMessage(string message)?
    The call will fail because the method requires a string parameter to execute

Why are methods with return values preferred for complex calculations?
    They allow the calculated result to be resused in other parts of the program

A developer creates a method to process an order and pass customer details as parameters. Why are parameters important for this method?
    Parameters allow the method to accept different customer details without altering the method's code

You are developing a library management system. Why would you create a function to calculate overdue fines based on the number of days late?
    To allow the calculation logic to be reused whenever fines need to be determined for different users

What is the advantage of planning a program by dividing it into smaller functions or methods?
    It makes the program easier to debug, test, and update, as each function handles a specific task
