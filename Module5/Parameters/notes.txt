ref -> faz referência ao parâmetro e permite atualizar o seu valor
    EXEMPLOS:
        UpdateValue(ref int num) -> permite alterar o valor de num

        void DoubleValue(ref int number) {
            number = number * 2;
        }
        É void porque não vai devolver um int mas sim atualizar o valor do int number
