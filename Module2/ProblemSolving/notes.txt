PRACTICE QUIZ:

1. What is the primary reason logical processes are essential in programming?
    To ensure the program performs tasks correctly and efficiently

2. How can deductive reasoning be applied in problem solving?
    By deriving specific solutions from general rules and principles

3. What is the benefit of decomposing a complex problem into smaller parts?
    It makes the problem easier to understand and solve incrementally

4. Which statement best describes the top-down approach in problem-solving?
    Breaking down a system into smaller components, starting from the highest level

5. Which of the following represents a guideline for writing effective pseudocode?
    Use clear, plain language to describe each logical step

GRADED QUIZ:

1. Why are iterations important in programming?
    They allow repetetive tasks to be executed until specific condition is met

2. What is a key benefit of using deductive reasoning in program design?
    It ensures that all components logically connect to achieve the desired outcome

3. How does problem decomposition benefit debugging?
    It helps isolate and address issues with smaller sections of code

4. When is the bottom-up approach most effective?
    When large-scale goals must be addressed before smaller details

5. How should pseudocode be structured to align with programming logic?
    It should resemble actual code with proper indentation and logical flow

6. How does the top-down approach simplify complex software development tasks?
    By breaking a large problem into smaller, more manageable tasks

7. When should you choose the bottom-up approach over the top-down approach?
    When components are developed independently and then integrated into a system

8. What is a key characteristic of sequences in programming?
    They execute they execute the code in the exact order it is written

9. How does problem decomposition contribute to program maintenance?
    By organizing the code into smaller sections, making updates easier 

10. What is a key guideline for writing pseudocode?
    Use plain and concise language to describe the logic
