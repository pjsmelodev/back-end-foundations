PSEUDOCODE:
    Detailed and readable description of what an algorithm must do, expressed in a natural language

PRACTICE ASSIGNMENT:

1. What are logical processes in programming?
    Fundamental components that control the flow and decision-making in code

2. Select 3 of the following types of logic used in programming.
    Boolean Logic,
    Conditional Logic,
    Loop Logic

3. How can developers use pseudocode effectively before writing actual code?
    To outline a detailed description of what a computer program must do, expressed in a natural language

4. Which tool would best visualize a sequence of steps in a program?
    Flowchart

5. Which of the following best describes the role of logical processes in programming, and why are they important?
    Logical processes involve using conditional statements, loops, and decision-making structures to control the flow of a program, ensuring that it behaves correctly under different conditions
