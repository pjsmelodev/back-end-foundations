DECOMPOSING SOFTWARE:
    1 - Identify the problem goal
    2 - Break it down into parts
    3 - Analyze and address
    4 - Integrate the solution

MODULARIZATION:
    Decomposition approach where you fragment a complex issue into smaller, INDEPENDENT parts that each carry out a specific role

PRACTICE ASSIGNMENT:
1. What is one primary benefit of decomposing a complex problem when debugging in software development?
    It allows developers to isolate and fix issues in smaller parts of the code

2. Which technique involves breaking a problem down into smaller, independent parts that perform specific functions?
    Modularization

3. You need to build a website for an online bookstore. Which of the following steps aligns with a top-down approach to problem decomposition?
    Start by defining the overall goal, then break it into main sections, such as the homepage, product pages, and checkout process

4. What is the first step in decomposing a complex problem for debugging and implementation?
    Identify the problem or goal
